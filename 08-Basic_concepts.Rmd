# Basic Concepts

## Score

The score is the gradient (the vector of partial derivatives) of $log L(\theta)$, with respect to an m-dimensional parameter vector $\theta$.

$$S(\theta) = \frac{\partial\ell}{\partial \theta}$$

Such differentiation will generate a $m\times 1$ row vector, which indicates the sensitivity of the likelihood.

Quote from Steffen Lauritzen's slides: "Generally the solution to this equation must be calculated by iterative methods. One of the most common methods is the Newton–Raphson
method and this is based on successive approximations to the solution, using Taylor’s theorem to approximate the equation."


For instance, using logit link, we can get the first derivative of log likelihood logistic regression as follows. We can not really find $\beta$ easily to make the equation to be 0. 

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \ell} {\partial \beta} 
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^T[y_i-\frac{e^{\beta^Tx_i}}{1+e^{\beta^Tx_i}}] \\
&=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^T[y_i-\hat{y_i}]
\end{aligned}$$

## Canonical link function

Inspired by a Stack Exchange post, I created the following figure:

$$ \frac{Paramter}{\theta} \longrightarrow \gamma^{'}(\theta) = \mu \longrightarrow \frac{Mean}{\mu} \longrightarrow g(\mu) = \eta \longrightarrow \frac{ Linear predictor}{\eta} $$


For the case of $n$ time Bernoulli (i.e., Binomial), its canonical link function is logit. Specifically, 

$$ \frac{Paramter}{\theta=\beta^Tx_i}  \longrightarrow \gamma^{'}(\theta)= \frac{e^{\beta^Tx_i}}{1+e^{\beta^Tx_i}}\longrightarrow \frac{Mean}{\mu=\frac{e^{\beta^Tx_i}}{1+e^{\beta^Tx_i}}}\longrightarrow g(\mu) = log \frac{\frac{e^{\beta^Tx_i}}{1+e^{\beta^Tx_i}}}{1-\frac{e^{\beta^Tx_i}}{1+e^{\beta^Tx_i}}}\longrightarrow \frac{ Linear predictor}{\eta = \beta^Tx_i}$$
Thus, we can see that,

$$\theta \equiv \eta $$
The link function $g(\mu)$ relates the linear predictor $\eta = \beta^Tx_i$ to the mean $\mu$.

__Remarks__:

(1) Parameter is $\theta = \beta ^T x_i$ (Not $\mu$!).  

(2) $\mu=p(y=1)=\frac{e^{\beta^Tx_i}}{1+e^{\beta^Tx_i}}$ (NOT logit!).

(3) Link function (i.e., $g(\mu)$) = logit = logarithm of odds = log $\frac{Event - Happened }{Event - Not - Happened}$.

(4) $g(\mu) = log \frac{\mu}{1-\mu}=\beta^T x_i$. Thus, link function = linear predictor = log odds! 

(5) Quote from the Stack Exchange post "Newton Method and Fisher scoring for finding the ML estimator coincide, these links simplify the derivation of the MLE."

(Recall, we know that $\mu$ or $p(y=1)$ is the mean function. Recall that, $n$ trails of coin flips, and get $p$ heads. Thus $\mu = \frac{p}{n}$.)

## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) 

Suppose we have $n$ observation, and $m$ variables.

$$\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} & ... & x_{1m}\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} & ... & x_{2m} \\
...\\
x_{n1} & x_{n2} & x_{n3} & ... & x_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}$$


Thus, we can write it as the following $n$ equations.

$$y_1=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{11}+\beta_2 x_{12}+...+ \beta_m x_{1m}$$
$$y_2=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{21}+\beta_2 x_{22}+...+ \beta_m x_{2m}$$
$$y_3=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{31}+\beta_2 x_{32}+...+ \beta_m x_{3m}$$
$$...$$

$$y_n=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{n1}+\beta_2 x_{n2}+...+ \beta_m x_{nm}$$

We can combine all the $n$ equations as the following one:

$$y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_{i1}+\beta_2 x_{i2}+...+ \beta_m x_{im}  (i \in [1,n])$$

We can further rewrite it as a matrix format as follows. 

$$y=X\beta+\epsilon$$
Where,

$$y = \begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\
y_2 \\
y_3 \\
y_4 \\
...\\
y_n \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$X=\begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} & ... & x_{1m}\\
1 & x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} & ... & x_{2m} \\
...\\
1 & x_{n1} & x_{n2} & x_{n3} & ... & x_{nm}
\end{bmatrix}$$


$$\beta = \begin{bmatrix}\beta_0 \\
\beta_1 \\
\beta_2 \\
\beta_3 \\
...\\
\beta_m \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

Since later
