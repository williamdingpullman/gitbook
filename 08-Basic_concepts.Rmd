# Basic Concepts

## Score

The score is the gradient (the vector of partial derivatives) of $log L(\theta)$, with respect to an m-dimensional parameter vector $\theta$.

$$S(\theta) = \frac{\partial (log L(\theta))}{\partial \theta}$$

Such differentiation yields a $m\times 1$ row vector, and indicates the sensitivity of the likelihood.
