## Introduction

The following code is from this website: http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~baolin/teaching/probmods/GLMM_mcmc.html. I will remove it on this page after I complete my practice and learning. 



In this example, it simulates a longitudinal data with 4 variables for each of 1000 separate individuals. Specifically, there are three continuous covariates (varying over time) and one ordinal covariate (constant over time). We will consider a random intercept model (mean zero and variance 100), and fit the data with glmer() from lme4 R package.

```{R}

n = 1000; p = 3; K = 4; sig = 10
set.seed(123)

## time varying covariates
Xl = vector('list', K)
for(k in 1:K) Xl[[k]] = matrix(rnorm(n*p), n,p)

## constant covariate
Z = rbinom(n, 2,0.2)

## random effects
U = rnorm(n)*sig

## fixed effects
etaX = sapply(Xl, rowSums)

## random errors
eps = matrix(rnorm(n*K), n,K)

## logit model
eta = etaX + U + eps
prb = 1/(1+exp(-eta))
D = 1*(matrix(runif(n*K),n,K)<prb)
Xs = Xl[[1]]
for(k in 2:K) Xs = rbind(Xs, Xl[[k]])
## GLMM model
library(lme4)
sid = rep(1:n, K)
## model fit with GLMMM (default to Laplace approximation)
a1 = glmer(c(D) ~ Xs + Z[sid] + (1|sid), family=binomial)

a1

```
