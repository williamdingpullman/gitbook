# Basic R

This section is about R coding.

## apply, lapply, sapply

### apply
```{R}
m_trying <- matrix(C<-(1:10),nrow=2, ncol=5)
m_trying

## Operating on the columns
apply(m_trying, 2, sum)

## Operating on the rows
apply(m_trying, 1, sum)

```

### lapply

"lapply returns a list of the same length as X, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X."

lapply operates on lists. Thus, as we can see below, even if m_trying is not a list, each cell becomes a list. 

```{R}
results1<-lapply(m_trying,sum)
str(results1)
is.list(results1)
```


### sapply
"sapply() function takes list, vector or data frame as input and gives output in vector or matrix."

```{R}
results2<-sapply(m_trying, sum)
str(results2)
is.list(results2)
is.matrix(results2)
is.data.frame(results2)
is.vector(results2)
```
